The following tools were made for educational purposes only. They should not be used for any unethical or illegal practices.

WHOIS LOOKUP: Ethical hackers use this tool frequently. I followed a tutorial to run a lookup locally by using a python script and to understand what kind of information can be obtained from a lookup.

PASSWORD GENERATOR: The stronger the password, the more difficult to come up with. I wrote a script that generates a password that is 8-12 chracters long, and has at least one uppercase, one lowercase, one digit, and one special character. This ensures that the password generated meets the common password requirements.


SUBSTITUTION CIPHER: One of the simplest encryption methods, and one I often played around with in elementary school. The script encrypts a message with a new key each time.

EMAIL SCRAPER: The issue of phishing emails has been around since the beginning of online communication. Learning how to build this tool showed me just how quickly websites can be searched for email addresses and personal information in general.
