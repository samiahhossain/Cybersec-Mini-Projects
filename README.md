The following tools were made for educational purposes only. They should not be used for any unethical or illegal practices.


WHOIS LOOKUP: Ethical hackers use this tool frequently. I followed a tutorial to run a lookup locally by using a python script and to understand what kind of information can be obtained from a lookup.

PASSWORD GENERATOR: The stronger the password, the more difficult to come up with. I wrote a script that generates a password that is 8-12 chracters long, and has at least one uppercase, one lowercase, one digit, and one special character. This ensures that the password generated meets the common password requirements.

SUBSTITUTION CIPHER: One of the simplest encryption methods, and one I often played around with in elementary school. The script encrypts a message with a new key each time.
